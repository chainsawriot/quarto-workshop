*"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do." *
[Donald Knuth]

## What is literate programming?

[Mixing a document formatting language and a programming language.]{style="font-size:30px"}

## Why use literate programming?

:::{.incremental}
- **Enhanced Readability**    
  [Emphasizes clear and coherent documentation alongside the code]{style="font-size:20pt"}

- **Improved Documentation**  
  [Documentation is an integral part of the program]{style="font-size:20pt"}

- **Code Reusability**  
  [Simpler to extract and adapt code components for use in other projects]{style="font-size:20pt"}

- **Education and Learning**  
  [can serve as an effective educational tool]{style="font-size:20pt"}

## Why use literate programming as an academic?

The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access purposes.


## Examples

Sweave - Early R and Latex integration (2002)  
Knitr - R in Latex, HTML, Markdown...(2012)  
RMarkdown - R/python/julia in Latex, Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, HTML (~2014)  
Jupyter Notebooks - anything with a jupyter kernel (~2014)  
Quarto - 

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
Itâ€™s designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats (e.g. .pdf, .docx).

## What is Quarto?

**open-source scientific and technical publishing system**  

- Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

- Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.

- Author using Jupyter notebooks or with plain text markdown in your favorite editor.

- Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

*"The concept is to make a major, long term investment in reproducible research, while keeping it compatible with existing formats and adaptable to the various environments users work in."*

## Quarto vs R Markdown

Similar pipeline:

**But**:  

- Quarto is like R Markdown, bookdown, xaringan, distill, etc. combined

- Quarto is multi-language and multi-engine (knitr, jupyter, observable, ...)
