"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do." 
[Donald Knuth]

##

Literate programs are written in a metalanguage that mixes a document formatting language (e.g., TEX or HTML) and 
a programming language (e.g., C++). 

The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access purposes.

## Examples

Sweave - Early R and Latex integration (2002)
Knitr - R in Latex, HTML, Markdown...(2012)
RMarkdown - R/python/julia in Latex, Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, HTML (~2014)
Jupyter Notebooks - anything with a jupyter kernel (~2014)
Quarto - 

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
Itâ€™s designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats (e.g. .pdf, .docx).
