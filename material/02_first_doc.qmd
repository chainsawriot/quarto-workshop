# Literate programming

Literate programming: mixing a **document formatting language** and a **programming language**.

In this session, we will focus on the document formatting language. And the programming language in the next session.

# Markdown

Markdown (`md`) is a light-weight markup language for creating formatted text. Quarto (and RMarkdown before it) uses `md` as the document formatting language. `md` is also used in many websites, e.g. Github, Hackmd; and many static site generators / software, e.g. Jekyll, Hugo, Slack, MS teams.

We will use Github as the testbed. And then we will try to create our first Quarto document and render it.

## Text formatting (The essential)

```md
Text attributes *italic*, **bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---
```

### Exercise:

Produce something like this:

a*b***c**`d`e**f**

```

[Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html)

Local file

```md
![cat](img/pic.png)
```

### Exercises:

Produce a list of websites (with links) you like to visit, e.g.

1. [Github](https://github.com/)
2. [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/)
3. [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/)

Find a dog picture on Wikipedia and link to it

Produce a sourced quote (Optional)

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. – [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

# Quarto document (qmd)

A qmd document looks like this

```md
---
title: "This is an example"
format: html
editor: source
---

# Hello

This is an `example`

1. Hello
2. World
3. Gesis


```

And it contains three parts

1. YAML Front-matter (optional)
2. Body
3. Code chunks (optional)

We'll deal with Code chunks and YAML later. Let's focus on the Body first.

To create a new Quarto document with RStudio: `New File` -> `Quarto Document`. (Or just create a new empty text file with your favorite text editor)

1. Source Editor / Visual Editor
2. Render button

By default, a Quarto document renders to HTML.

### Rendering

Suppose you want to render `test.qmd`

```bash
## by default to: test.html
quarto render test.qmd

## other filename
quarto render test.qmd -o index.html
```

Preview

```bash
quarto preview test.qmd
```

### Exercises:

Try out all the markups you know in a Quarto document

Tips: render as often as you can to see the changes

### Project:

Create your CV as a `qmd` file
