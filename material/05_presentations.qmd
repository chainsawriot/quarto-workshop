# Basic Exercise

- Using RStudio, create a new revealjs Quarto presentation
- Change YAML:  
    - author for your name
    - titled “My first Quarto Presentation!”
    - Add slide numbering (what do the different types mean?)
- Write out what you did this morning (woke up, ate breakfast, walked to this room, etc) in sub-sections
- Add a code chunk and try out different output locations
- Link out to an image with markdown syntax
- Render it!

# More advanced features

- Add 4 new slides
  - Create a list of incremental reveal (`:::` + `.incremental`)
  - Create at least two `:::` div fragments (`.fragment` + one of `.fade-out` + `.highlight-red` + `.fade-in-then-out`)
  - Add one span fragment with `[text]{.fragment .type-of-fragment}` syntax
  - One with a code highlighting walking through at least two lines

# Theming

- change the background color of one slide
- add a background image to a slide
- change the theme of the presentation
- (*if you are comfortable with CSS*) add a `custom.scss` file and change a few variables

# Project

Take any old presentation of yours. Would you be able to recreate it with Quarto?
If so, try. If not, what feature are you missing?
